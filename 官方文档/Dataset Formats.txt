Dataset formats and types
This guide provides an overview of the dataset formats and types supported by each trainer in TRL.

Overview of the dataset formats and types
The format of a dataset refers to how the data is structured, typically categorized as either standard or conversational.
The type is associated with the specific task the dataset is designed for, such as prompt-only or preference. Each type is characterized by its columns, which vary according to the task, as shown in the table.

Type \ Format	
Standard	
Conversational

Language modeling	
{"text": "The sky is blue."}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is blue."}]}
Prompt-only	
{"prompt": "The sky is"}
{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"}]}

Prompt-completion	
{"prompt": "The sky is",
 "completion": " blue."}
{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"}],
 "completion": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It is blue."}]}

Preference	
{"prompt": "The sky is",
 "chosen": " blue.",
 "rejected": " green."}
or, with implicit prompt:
{"chosen": "The sky is blue.",
 "rejected": "The sky is green."}
{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"}],
 "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It is blue."}],
 "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It is green."}]}
or, with implicit prompt:
{"chosen": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is blue."}],
 "rejected": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is green."}]}

Unpaired preference	
{"prompt": "The sky is",
 "completion": " blue.",
 "label": True}
{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"}],
 "completion": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It is green."}],
 "label": False}

Stepwise supervision	
{"prompt": "Which number is larger, 9.8 or 9.11?",
 "completions": ["The fractional part of 9.8 is 0.8.",
                 "The fractional part of 9.11 is 0.11.",
                 "0.11 is greater than 0.8.",
                 "Hence, 9.11 > 9.8."],
 "labels": [True, True, False, False]}
