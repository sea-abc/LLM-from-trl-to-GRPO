Quick start
This example demonstrates how to train a model using the GRPO method. We train a Qwen 0.5B Instruct model with the prompts from the DeepMath-103K dataset. You can view the data in the dataset here:
Below is the script to train the model.
```python
# train_grpo.py
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import GRPOTrainer
from trl.rewards import accuracy_reward

dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/DeepMath-103K", split="train")

trainer = GRPOTrainer(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct",
    reward_funcs=accuracy_reward,
    train_dataset=dataset,
)
trainer.train()
```
Execute the script using the following command:
```bash
accelerate launch train_grpo.py
```
Distributed across 8 GPUs, the training takes approximately 1 day.
